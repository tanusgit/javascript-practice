00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.820
Uh huh.

2
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.910
Open up a laptop. You know what to do, want to

3
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.460
come around, but the party coming through has me

4
00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.680
saving gas in the mood to stay on track. And I'm

5
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.140
never coming because this quarter going to go real

6
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.680
fast. Like soon we all go. So turn up in the house,

7
00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.840
turn it to a classroom, staying safe. And I'm on

8
00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.700
camera wearing my pajamas. It don't matter, baby.

9
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.630
Yeah, we chileno we could've been at it all. So we

10
00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.690
all go math class on the sofa, chemistry at the

11
00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.770
pool, got a virtual campus getting all the answers,

12
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.720
solving no problems, obtain the right to. Okay, I

13
00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.840
told you. Stop, wait, stand up. If you just wash

14
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.150
your hands, go and put your hands up and put them

15
00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.610
back down, navigate the campus. I got like three

16
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.760
classes completion. What I plan Lincoln didn't

17
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.160
even need a password or something that could end

18
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.130
up chilling with the class in the lab with a lab

19
00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.320
coat. Now, that's why I broke Cookie while I'm

20
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.180
spinning. I'm at Starbucks. You don't have a

21
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.540
laptop. I just own one. They got the Chrome books.

22
00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.870
Got a long one. I got the wi fi plug into the moat.

23
00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.710
Don't get me. Up with the crossing of a loan, some

24
00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.370
you missed a lecture because I did need help, send

25
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.360
an e-mail and ignore it. They got the website, go

26
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.380
and explore it, never skip the info. That's a

27
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.310
laptop. You know what to do. Want to come around

28
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.940
for the party coming through has been saving gas

29
00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.940
in the mood to stay on track and then never come

30
00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.900
in last because this quarter is going to go real

31
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.080
fast. Like soon we are going to turn up in the

32
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.320
house, turned into a classroom, staying safe and

33
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.100
I'm on camera wearing my pajamas. It don't matter.

34
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.170
Yeah, we should wake up and narrow it down soon.

35
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.860
We are going to be cooking in the kitchen camera.

36
00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.450
Not got a virtual campus. Didn't know the answer

37
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.030
to solving problems. Obtain the right tools I've

38
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.080
been letting on. So we all go to class on this. A

39
00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.630
virtual campus, and they got all the answers,

40
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.730
solving the problems and getting the right way to

41
00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.090
stop it. Like, I don't get it, although I read it

42
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.890
for, like, the past couple of hundred thousand

43
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.210
milliseconds and get the message. And I was

44
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.390
stressing and talking bank accounts, but I think I

45
00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.760
need to check in with minutes. It's OK. No need

46
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.800
for doesn't get a tutor's lesson through computer

47
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.930
methods or according to what they be telling most

48
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.610
of your successes, because, you know, it's proven

49
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.790
they go help you whenever you be needed to get the

50
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.010
message. Yeah. Rocking at home to be safe from the

51
00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.500
rainfall and not reach out to find help from my

52
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.470
grades for got support on my back. I'm a stay at

53
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.210
home. Think of all the people in the world. They

54
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.030
got to pray for worlds facing the challenge. Begin

55
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.400
for it to stay at home, play a part in being the

56
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.590
solution. Whatever you struggle, just keep on

57
00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.390
moving through it. I know that when it comes to

58
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.090
academics, we be zooming through the laptop. You

59
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.280
know what to do. What is going to come around for

60
00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.950
